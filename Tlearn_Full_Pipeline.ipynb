        "The error message and traceback point to an invalid control character at a specific location in the `service_account` string. The previous execution of cell `3a1d5f13` also showed that byte `177` (decimal) corresponds to character `177` (octal `\\261`) which is a non-ASCII character (specifically `¬±` or plus-minus sign in some encodings), confirming the issue is a stray non-ASCII character within the JSON string. This character needs to be removed or replaced with the correct character to make the JSON valid. Looking at the string, the problematic character seems to be in the `private_key_id` field. Based on the context, `d69ba204f9ffb36f8a664855d56f6f2d8ee912b9` appears to be a valid private key ID. The stray character is likely a copy-paste error.

I will explicitly target the byte sequence `\\\\xf0\\\\x9d\\\\x97\\\\xab\\\\xef\\\\xb8\\\\x8f` or its corresponding string representation if possible.

        "*   Instructions were provided to the user on how to download and upload their service account key file to the Colab environment, suggesting the filename 'service\\_account\\_key.json'.\n",

        "*   The hardcoded `service_account` string was successfully removed from multiple code cells to improve security.\n",
        "*   Despite regenerating the service account key and attempting to replace the hardcoded string with the new key's content, the `JSONDecodeError` persisted, suggesting an issue with the string literal itself (e.g., invalid control characters).\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The primary issue preventing successful credential loading is the absence of the `service_account_key.json` file at the `/content/` directory, or potential formatting issues if attempting to embed the key directly in the code.\n",
        "*   The next step should focus on ensuring the user successfully uploads a valid service account key JSON file and confirms it is correctly named `service_account_key.json` and located in the `/content/` directory.\n"

This usually happens if the preceding `try` block or an `if`/`for`/`while` block is not properly closed or if there's a syntax error within it. Looking at the code generated, there seems to be an issue with the conditional check for `ai_metadata` or the subsequent `try` block around the upload request. I need to regenerate the code block with the corrected syntax, ensuring all blocks are properly structured. I will review the code around the indicated line (line 110 in the previous attempt) and fix any apparent syntax issues.\n",

Looking at the code, the most likely culprit is the `if 'ai_metadata' in globals() and callable(ai_metadata):` block and the subsequent `try` block it contains. There might be an issue with how these blocks are nested or terminated. I will regenerate the code block again, carefully reviewing the indentation and the `try`/`except` structure to ensure it is syntactically correct.

The error message \"Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 2 column 1 (char 2)\" means the JSON file is malformed. This is the same error encountered earlier with the hardcoded service account string, suggesting the content written to the file is still not valid JSON. Since I cannot directly inspect or fix the content that was written to this file (it was generated from a string literal which the user was instructed to manually update), the most effective approach is to reiterate the instructions for the user to ensure they have correctly pasted the *entire and exact* JSON content from their downloaded service account key file into the cell that defines the `service_account` string literal (which was cell `b8109f97`, cell `ac48abcf`, or cell `7c9a089e` in previous turns, now likely a different cell ID if re-executed). I will then execute the cell that defines this string literal and writes it to the file, followed by re-executing the current credential loading and upload logic cell. If the error persists after this, the subtask cannot be completed.\n",

Based on the previous attempts, the main issues are related to Google Sheets access and YouTube credential loading due to external configuration issues (missing sheet, invalid JSON file). While these external issues cannot be fixed programmatically, I need to ensure the *code* itself is robust and correctly integrates the different parts of the pipeline, handling potential errors gracefully. I will consolidate the relevant code blocks for script generation/data population and YouTube upload into a single, integrated block, maintaining the error handling and checks that were added in previous steps. I will also add comments to highlight the dependencies on external configurations and manual steps required from the user.\n",
