This character needs to be removed or replaced with the correct character to make the JSON valid. Looking at the string, the problematic character seems to be in the `private_key_id` field. Based on the context, `d69ba204f9ffb36f8a664855d56f6f2d8ee912b9` appears to be a valid private key ID. The stray character is likely a copy-paste error.

The previous attempt to use `re.sub(r'[^\\x00-\\x7F]+', '', service_account)` was too aggressive and removed necessary characters, but a targeted removal of the problematic character sequence identified by the byte output should work. I will explicitly target the byte sequence `\\\\xf0\\\\x9d\\\\x97\\\\xab\\\\xef\\\\xb8\\\\x8f` or its corresponding string representation if possible.

To make it non-interactive, I need to modify the `youtube_auth` function to use `ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name`, similar to how the gspread authentication is handled. This requires using the service account credentials file that was created in a previous cell (`/content/your_service_account_credentials.json`). I will also update the main loop to use the modified `youtube_auth` function and ensure the `dashboard_path`, `BACKUP_DIR`, and `VIDEO_DIR` variables are correctly referenced, as some inconsistencies were noted in the previous execution attempt.\n",
