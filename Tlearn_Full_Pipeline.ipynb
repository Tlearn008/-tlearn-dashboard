        "The error message and traceback point to an invalid control character at a specific location in the `service_account` string. The previous execution of cell `3a1d5f13` also showed that byte `177` (decimal) corresponds to character `177` (octal `\\261`) which is a non-ASCII character (specifically `¬±` or plus-minus sign in some encodings), confirming the issue is a stray non-ASCII character within the JSON string. This character needs to be removed or replaced with the correct character to make the JSON valid. Looking at the string, the problematic character seems to be in the `private_key_id` field. Based on the context, `d69ba204f9ffb36f8a664855d56f6f2d8ee912b9` appears to be a valid private key ID. The stray character is likely a copy-paste error.

The previous attempt to use `re.sub(r'[^\\x00-\\x7F]+', '', service_account)` was too aggressive and removed necessary characters, but a targeted removal of the problematic character sequence identified by the byte output should work. I will explicitly target the byte sequence `\\\\xf0\\\\x9d\\\\x97\\\\xab\\\\xef\\\\xb8\\\\x8f` or its corresponding string representation if possible.

        "*   Regenerating the service account key in Google Cloud Console and pasting the new content into the notebook code did not resolve the `JSONDecodeError` after multiple attempts.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   The issue likely stems from how the JSON content, particularly the private key with escaped newlines, is being copied, pasted, or interpreted within the notebook cell, rather than an issue with the key itself.\n",
        "*   A potential next step could involve storing the service account key securely outside of the notebook code (e.g., in a secret manager or a file uploaded directly) and loading it programmatically to avoid manual pasting issues.\n"
